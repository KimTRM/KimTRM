# 👋 Hi, I'm Kim Louise T. Labrador

I’m a BS Computer Science student with a passion for building things, whether that’s a game, a website, or a simple tool that makes life easier. I enjoy mixing creativity with tech, and most of my projects combine programming, design, and storytelling. I’m always learning, experimenting, and looking for ways to grow both as a developer and as an artist.
