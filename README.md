# 👋 Hi, I'm Kim Louise T. Labrador

💡 **Developer | Designer | Creator**  
I’m a **BS Computer Science student** passionate about building things that matter—games, websites, apps, and tools that combine **creativity, logic, and storytelling**. I love experimenting, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into projects that teach, inspire, or solve real problems.
